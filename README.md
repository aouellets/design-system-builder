# Design System Builder

**For design/UI engineers: ship a production design system, tokens to handoff.** — built in-house by [Skill&nbsp;Me](https://skillme.dev).

Reach for this when you're standing up or maturing a real design system and need every layer to fit together — not a pile of one-off design tips. You get a coherent token architecture (global → semantic → component) with theming and dark mode, accessible color and contrast, a consistent icon and motion system, clean component APIs, and implementation-ready specs your engineers can build from. The result is a system that stays consistent across light/dark, scales past the first few screens, and survives the handoff to engineering.

⭐ **If this is useful, star the repo** — it's how we gauge what to build next.
